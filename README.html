What I learned: 
Terma that will help me remember :-)
function(){} Is like a house and you can use everything inside of it
If / else {}  with If else statement, dont nest them so you can avoid issues


For loops REMINDER that after each loop you must hae the counter to not have an infinit loops

for loops the count must be inside the border

EXAMPLE BELOW:

while(count <= 100){ // Check if count is 100 or less, otherwise stop the loop

    if (){ 
     
     }else if(){
        
     }else if (){
     
     }else{
         
     }
     
        count++; inside the bordere NOT OUT
         console.log(output);// just number
 }
