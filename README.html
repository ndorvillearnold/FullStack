BEFORE you send anything to my remote branch, MAKE SURE you PULL MAIN or i wont get the lates changes of the branck

ALWAYS PULL MAIN BEFORE PUSHING INTO
=======

What I learned: 
Terma that will help me remember :-)
function(){} Is like a house and you can use everything inside of it
If / else {}  with If else statement, dont nest them so you can avoid issues


For loops REMINDER that after each loop you must hae the counter to not have an infinit loops

for loops the count must be inside the border

EXAMPLE BELOW:

while(count <= 100){ // Check if count is 100 or less, otherwise stop the loop

    if (){ 
     
     }else if(){
        
     }else if (){
     
     }else{
         
     }
     
        count++; inside the bordere NOT OUT
         console.log(output);// just number
 }


 ~ ALWAYS test EACH if statement and test all conditions before adding the next condition to test errors
 
 ~If the console log ever seems like a staircase for the output the console is in the wrong place


 ----------------------------------------------------------
 ~Also with while looops in funcitons the empty array can go globally or locally in the function
 NOTE: only when you want to use it for another function you should put it outside if not put it inside

 let output = [];
 let count = 1;


 function bottleChallenge(){

let output = [];
 let count = 1;

 while(){


 }
 }
